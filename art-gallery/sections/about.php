            <p>Since my primary schooling, I have been winning competitions and certificates in art and craft and that
                was enough to encourage me to do something in art. In my higher school I won an embroidery competition
                scoring third position and everybody was surprised to see a boy winning it. After having completed my
                higher school education I joined senior secondary school in science stream (physics, chemistry and math)
                as science was my favourite subject after art. Secondly, science and engineering are considered most
                employable streams in India. After completing my senior secondary education I decided to do CPA
                (Computer Programmer Analyst, Georgian College, Canada). When I completed the study tenure of three
                years; I was awarded with Computer Programmer Analyst Diploma (CPA), with Honours, from Georgian
                College, Canada and Bachelor of Computer Applications Degree (BCA), in First Division, from Punjab
                Technical University, India.</p>

            <p>For the successful completion of the CPA program I had to do 3 Co-Op training(s), 1 Co-Op each year. I
                did the first Co-Op as a flash animator, which was a mix-match of design and programming and I made my
                mind that I will definitely do something in Multimedia. During the second Co-Op, I worked as a Technical
                Support Executive in DELL (I worked on the technical issues and troubleshooting), and in the third Co-op
                I worked as a Web/Graphic Designer. I possess a keen eye and good hand at sketching and wanted to try my
                hand in Graphic Design and joined Graphic Design Certificate Program (in association with UCOL). I had
                never scored a grade lower than "A" in my Graphic Design Program. I was the best graphic design student
                and my Institute Director and Program Coordinator hired me for a commercial project in which I had to
                design an invitation card and a poster for fashion show which was supposed to be held at the CIIS. I did
                not just design the card and the poster, but also organized and participated in the fashion show and the
                cultural event.</p>

            <p>Recently I was working as a fulltime Graphic/Web Designer and I have designed a latest website
                www.gizmosupport.com. Now-a-days you can see Flash on almost every website and people love to see
                beautiful interactive interfaces. I have seen websites like www.mtv.com which are fully made using
                Flash. I think there will a time when we will have loads of websites which will totally have a flash
                interface. Like flash is for web FlashLite is the new technology to take flash to Mobile. Flash has
                endless possibilities and we can not just design and program games in flash but also build applications.
